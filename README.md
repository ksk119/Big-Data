# Big-Data Project on Airline Analysis.

Here in this project i have tried to Analyse the performance of the airport, found few improvement areas where the business operations has to be improved in order to attract more customers and make more money out of it.

In this project we have collected the data and loaded it to the Spark, performed data cleansing , wrangling & then performed some Exploratory Data Analysis,Build few models.
Loaded the cleanded data to the Mongo Db server.

Overall it was a great learning, enjoyed exploring Spark and building the entire pipeline.
